## Summary

Project Description:

This project was inspired by the game genre that became popular during the peak of Warcraft 3's custom games scene.

The objective was to develop a tower defence game that harkens back to those days and share it with my mates.

For me personally, this project is an effort to develop my skills and produce something to completion.
