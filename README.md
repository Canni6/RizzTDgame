# Rizz TD

## Summary
### Goal: Tower Defence Game Prototype
### Theme: Interstellar
### Music/Sounds: Guitars, random objects
### Models/Art: Blender/Unity

This project was inspired by the game genre that became popular during the peak of Warcraft 3's custom games scene.

I wanted to develop a tower defence game that harkens back to those days to share with my mates.

A personal project to develop and share my skills with the internet.
